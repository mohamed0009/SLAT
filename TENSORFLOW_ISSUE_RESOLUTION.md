# TensorFlow Import Issue Resolution

## Problem Summary
The Django application was failing to start due to a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'` error. This occurred because:

1. **Python Version Incompatibility**: The system is running Python 3.13.3, but TensorFlow currently only supports Python 3.9-3.12
2. **Missing TensorFlow Installation**: TensorFlow was listed in requirements.txt but not installed due to version incompatibility

## Root Cause
TensorFlow does not yet support Python 3.13. According to the official TensorFlow GitHub issue #78774, Python 3.13 support will be available in a future release (likely TensorFlow 2.19 or later).

## Solution Implemented
We implemented a **simplified model approach** that allows the Django application to run without TensorFlow:

### 1. Modified Views (sign_language_detection/detection/views.py)
- Commented out TensorFlow-based model import: `from .model import SignLanguageModel`
- Updated prediction functions to use the existing simplified model
- Added missing view functions referenced in URLs

### 2. Simplified Model (sign_language_detection/detection/model_loader_simple.py)
- Already existed and works without TensorFlow
- Provides mock predictions for testing
- Returns random sign language letters with confidence scores
- Maintains the same API interface as the full model

### 3. API Endpoints Working
- Health check: `http://localhost:8000/app/api/health/`
- Model info: `http://localhost:8000/app/api/model-info/`
- Prediction endpoints: Available but return mock data

## Current Status
✅ **Django server is running successfully**
✅ **All system checks pass**
✅ **API endpoints are responding**
✅ **No more import errors**

## Limitations of Current Solution
- **Mock predictions only**: The model returns random letters, not real sign language detection
- **No actual TensorFlow functionality**: Machine learning features are disabled
- **Limited accuracy**: Confidence scores are randomly generated

## Long-term Solutions

### Option 1: Downgrade Python (Recommended for Production)
```bash
# Install Python 3.12 (latest supported by TensorFlow)
# Then create a virtual environment with Python 3.12
python3.12 -m venv tf_env
source tf_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: tf_env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 2: Wait for TensorFlow 2.19
- TensorFlow 2.19 is expected to support Python 3.13
- Monitor the GitHub issue: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/78774

### Option 3: Use Alternative ML Libraries
- Consider PyTorch (supports Python 3.13)
- Use ONNX Runtime for model inference
- Implement with scikit-learn for simpler models

## Testing the Current Setup

### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/app/api/health/
```

### 2. Model Information
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/app/api/model-info/
```

### 3. Access the Web Interface
Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8000/`

## Next Steps for Full Functionality

1. **Install Python 3.12** alongside Python 3.13
2. **Create a virtual environment** with Python 3.12
3. **Install TensorFlow** in the Python 3.12 environment
4. **Switch the model import** back to the TensorFlow-based version
5. **Test real sign language detection**

## Files Modified
- `sign_language_detection/detection/views.py` - Updated imports and prediction logic
- `TENSORFLOW_ISSUE_RESOLUTION.md` - This documentation file

## Dependencies Status
- ✅ Django: Working
- ✅ NumPy: Working  
- ✅ OpenCV: Working
- ❌ TensorFlow: Not compatible with Python 3.13
- ✅ Other packages: Working

The application is now functional for development and testing purposes, with a clear path forward for implementing full TensorFlow functionality.
